// Knight Escape 
// This game was from one of my projects in college. 
// It features an 8x8 chess board with 62 white knights, 1 free space, and 1 black knight that has to work his way into the free space.
// Press M to move, R to reset the game, and X to exit the game.
// Once M is pressed, press Enter, then enter 2 numbers separated by space like such: "12 8".
// This will move the piece in position 12 to position 8, assuming one of the spots is empty.
// Each move costs 5 points and trying to move two filled spaces results in a deduction of 10 points.
